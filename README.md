Arcade Game
===============================


Your mission is to get across the bugs and get into the water. 
(I mean tiles at the top, you should not try swimming with your computer/device).

Don't let the bugs touch you, or you'll have to start over.

###

All you need is the arrows on the keyboard to move, and occasionally the 'R' button. You can trash the rest of your keyboard keys.

### Reset/Restart

When you get to the watery tiles, you can restart by pressing R on your keyboard.

Also, pressing 'R' at any moment will reset the game.


### How to load

Load index.html in your favourite browser, bugs don't care.


Have fun!
