Arcade Game
===============================

## How to Play

Your mission is to get across the bugs and get into the water. 
(I mean tiles at the top, you should not try swimming with your computer/device).

Don't let the bugs touch you, or you'll have to start over.

You can use arrows on the keyboard to move.

### Reset/Restart

When you get to the watery tiles, you can restart by pressing R on your keyboard.

Pressing R at any moment will reset the game.



### How to load
